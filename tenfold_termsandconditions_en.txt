		<h2 id="a">Terms and Conditions</h2>
		<p id="a1" style="text-align:justify">By downloading or using this NAMAAPLIKASI app (herein after referred as SERVICE), these terms will automatically apply to You (herein after referred as USER), therefore USER should make sure that USER read them carefully before using SERVICE. USER is not allowed to modify SERVICE, any part of SERVICE, in any way. USER is not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of SERVICE, and USER also shouldn't try to translate SERVICE into other languages, or make derivative versions. SERVICE itself still belongs to Tenfold (herein after referred as PROVIDER).</p>
		<p id="a2" style="text-align:justify">PROVIDER is committed to ensuring that SERVICE is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, PROVIDER reserves the right to make changes to SERVICE at any time and for any reason.</p>
		<p id="a3" style="text-align:justify">SERVICE may stores and processes personal data that USER have provided to PROVIDER in order to provide this SERVICE. Further details regarding personal data can be found in the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rewardedtenfold/pptnc/main/tenfold_privacypolicy_en.txt"><u>Privacy Policy</u></a>.</p>
		<p id="a4" style="text-align:justify">It's USER's responsibility to keep secure of USER's device which has SERVICE installed, and its access to SERVICE as well. PROVIDER therefore recommends that USER does not jailbreak or root USER's device, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of USER's device. It could make USER's device vulnerable to malwares, viruses, malicious programs, and compromise USER's device's security features and it could mean that SERVICE won't work properly or at all.</p>
		<p id="a5" style="text-align:justify">USER should be aware that there are certain things that PROVIDER will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of SERVICE will require SERVICE to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by USER's mobile network provider, but PROVIDER cannot take responsibility for SERVICE not working at full functionality if USER doesn't have access to Wi-Fi and USER doesn't have any of mobile data quota allowance left.</p>
		<p id="a6" style="text-align:justify">If USER is using SERVICE outside of an area with Wi-Fi, USER should remember that USER's terms of the agreement with USER's mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, USER may be charged by USER's mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing SERVICE, or other third party charges. In using SERVICE, USER is accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if USER uses SERVICE outside of USER's home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If USER is not the bill payer for the device on which USER is using SERVICE, please be aware that PROVIDER assumes that USER has received permission from the bill payer for using SERVICE.</p>
		<p id="a7" style="text-align:justify">Along the same lines, PROVIDER cannot always take responsibility for the way USER uses SERVICE i.e. USER needs to make sure that USER's device stays charged, if USER's device runs out of battery and USER can't turn it on to avail SERVICE, PROVIDER cannot accept responsibility.</p>
		<p id="a8" style="text-align:justify">With respect to PROVIDER's responsibility for USER's use of SERVICE, when USER is using SERVICE, it's important to bear in mind that although PROVIDER endeavour to ensure that SERVICE is updated and correct at all times, PROVIDER does rely on third parties to provide information to PROVIDER so that PROVIDER can make it available to USER. PROVIDER accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, USER experiences as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of SERVICE.</p>
		<p id="a9" style="text-align:justify">At some point, PROVIDER may wish to update SERVICE. SERVICE is currently available on Google Play Store. The requirements for system (and for any additional systems PROVIDER decides to extend the availability of SERVICE to) may change, and USER will need to download the updates if USER wants to keep using SERVICE. PROVIDER does not promise that PROVIDER will always update SERVICE so that SERVICE is relevant to USER and/or works with the version that USER has installed on USER's device. However, USER promises to always accept updates to SERVICE when offered to USER. PROVIDER may also wish to stop providing SERVICE, and may terminate use of SERVICE at any time without giving notice of termination to USER. Unless PROVIDER tells USER otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to USER in these terms will end; (b) USER must stop using SERVICE, and (if needed) delete it from USER's device.</p>
		<h3 id="b">Changes to This Terms and Conditions</h3>
		<p id="b1" style="text-align:justify">PROVIDER may update this Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, USER is advised to review this page periodically for any changes. PROVIDER will notify USER of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
		<h3 id="c">Contact Us</h3>
		<p id="c1" style="text-align:justify">If USER has any questions or suggestions about this Terms and Conditions, USER may contact PROVIDER at rewardedtenfold@gmail.com.</p>
